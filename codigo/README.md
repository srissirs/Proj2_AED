In this project, given two locations, we indicate the “best” route to go from one location to the other, using the
STCP net.

"Best" route:
- Best price
- Shortest distance
- Less changes between lines
- Less bus stops

Users can chose a distance that they agree to walk between stops. They also indicate if they want to see night lines, daily lines or both!
